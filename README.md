# PASAD

This is the assignment repository of Group 5 for the course CS658. This repository contains the implementation of __PASAD__ (in Python) on the __SWaT__ and __TE__ Datasets. Process-Aware Stealthy Attack Detection (PASAD) is an advanced method used to detect cyber-physical attacks on industrial control systems (ICS). Unlike traditional security measures that focus on network traffic or software signatures, PASAD leverages the dynamics of physical processes themselves to identify anomalies indicative of a stealthy cyber attack. It is based on the paper [Truth Will Out: Departure-Based Process-Level Detection of Stealthy Attacks on Control Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3243734.3243781).
